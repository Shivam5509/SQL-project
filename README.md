## Analyzing Employee Trends

### Project Description:
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of HR employee data to uncover key insights and trends. The dataset included details about employees such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition rates, and more. Using SQL, I explored the data to derive actionable insights for decision-making.

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted comprehensive data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset to ensure data quality.
2. **Employee Counts and Averages**: Wrote complex SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, and distributions across dimensions such as department, age, and education.
3. **Job Roles and Satisfaction**: Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to gain insights into organizational trends.
4. **Attrition Rates**: Calculated employee attrition rates segmented by age band to identify high-risk groups and develop retention strategies.
5. **Attrition Drivers**: Analyzed factors related to attrition, such as age, education, and job satisfaction, to uncover key drivers behind employee turnover.
6. **Comparing Metrics**: Compared average metrics and aggregates across different employee segments using SQL features like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and conditional logic (`CASE` statements).
7. **Top/Bottom Performers**: Identified top and bottom performers based on key metrics such as job satisfaction and attrition.
8. **SQL Techniques**: Utilized advanced SQL techniques such as:
   - **JOINs** for combining tables,
   - **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for structuring complex queries,
   - **WINDOW functions** for analytical calculations (e.g., `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`),
   - **Aggregate functions** for calculating totals and averages.
9. **Presentation of Findings**: Organized and presented key findings to leadership, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
