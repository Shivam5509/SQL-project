## Analyzing Employee Trends

### Project Description:
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of HR employee data to uncover key insights and trends. The dataset included details about employees such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition rates, and more. Using SQL, I explored the data to derive actionable insights for decision-making.

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted comprehensive data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset to ensure data quality.
2. **Employee Counts and Averages**: Wrote complex SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, and distributions across dimensions such as department, age, and education.
3. **Job Roles and Satisfaction**: Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to gain insights into organizational trends.
4. **Attrition Rates**: Calculated employee attrition rates segmented by age band to identify high-risk groups and develop retention strategies.
5. **Attrition Drivers**: Analyzed factors related to attrition, such as age, education, and job satisfaction, to uncover key drivers behind employee turnover.
6. **Comparing Metrics**: Compared average metrics and aggregates across different employee segments using SQL features like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and conditional logic (`CASE` statements).
7. **Top/Bottom Performers**: Identified top and bottom performers based on key metrics such as job satisfaction and attrition.
8. **SQL Techniques**: Utilized advanced SQL techniques such as:
   - **JOINs** for combining tables,
   - **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for structuring complex queries,
   - **WINDOW functions** for analytical calculations (e.g., `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`),
   - **Aggregate functions** for calculating totals and averages.
9. **Presentation of Findings**: Organized and presented key findings to leadership, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

# Student Database Project

## Overview
The **Student Database Project** is designed to efficiently store and manage student information. This project includes features like adding, updating, deleting, and querying student data from a structured database. The database captures essential details such as student IDs, personal information, academic performance, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to facilitate easy access to student records, improve data management, and generate insights from the data.

## Features
- **Add New Student Records**: Input data such as name, age, GPA, and skills into the database.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify student details like GPA, major, or skill proficiency.
- **Delete Student Records**: Remove students from the database as needed.
- **Query Student Information**: Search for students based on criteria such as GPA, skill set, major, or future career goals.
- **Data Analysis**: Generate insights like student rankings by GPA, skill proficiencies, and career goals.
- **Skill Proficiency Stats**: Track and filter students based on their expertise in SQL, Python, and other relevant skills.

## Database Structure
- **Students Table**: Stores basic student details like student ID, name, age, major, and GPA.
- **Skills Table**: Stores student proficiencies in skills like SQL, Python, etc.
- **Career Goals Table**: Stores information about students' future career preferences.
- **Courses Table**: Contains information about courses taken by students, including course name, credits, and associated student IDs.

### SQL Skills Demonstrated:
- **CRUD Operations**: Expertise in writing SQL queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
- **JOINs**: Combining data from multiple tables to answer complex business questions.
- **CTEs**: Using Common Table Expressions to simplify complex queries.
- **WINDOW Functions**: Leveraging functions like `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER` to perform advanced analytics.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Proficiency with `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc., for summarizing data.
- **Conditional Logic**: Using `CASE` statements for custom data transformations.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Strong ability to clean and preprocess data for analysis.
- **Performance Optimization**: Familiarity with optimizing SQL queries for better performance.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Microsoft sql server)**: Used for creating and managing the student database.
- **Python (optional)**: For connecting and manipulating data through database queries.
- **Pandas (optional)**: For analyzing student data programmatically.
- **Power BI (optional)**: For visualizing key insights from the student database.
- **MS Excel (optional)**: For data import/export and reporting.
